# Code to refactor

1. app/Http/Controllers/BookingController.php
2. app/Repository/BookingRepository.php

1- BookingController.php

    . Controller code ir written good.
    . But there is no request validation implemented on store function and update function. so I update the request validation on store function and remove the unneccessary fields checking conditions from repository because the request validator do that for me and if some fields are missing it will return the error messages defined in the request validator.
    . Utilized the ternary operator to set default values for variables.
    . Simplified the flag conditions using ternary operators.
    . Used the update() method with an array of column-value pairs for database updates.
    . Removed unnecessary if else conditions.

2- BookingRepository.php

    . Used array shorthand syntax for better readability and simplicity.
    . Used Carbon::now() instead of date('Y-m-d H:i:s') for consistency and improved code readability.
    . Added comments to explain the purpose of each section of the code.
    . Improved the variable naming for better understanding and clarity. Used consistent variable naming conventions. Renamed variables to use camelCase naming convention for consistency.
    . Removed the commented-out code for cleaner code structure.
    . Used the pluck method instead of lists to retrieve the email values directly as an array.
    . Replaced the DB facade calls with the User model to retrieve user information.
    . Enhanced code formatting and indentation for better readability.
    . Removed unnecessary variable assignments.
    . Combined the saving of the job and translator job relation into a single block.
    . Simplified the return statement by directly returning an array.
    . Introduced a separate helper method getJobType to determine the job type based on the translator type, improving code readability and reusability.
    . Used strict comparison (===) instead of loose comparison (==) for comparing values.
    . Move some function to helper function.
    . Used square bracket syntax [] for defining arrays instead of the array() syntax.
    . Consolidated the assignment of $data and $msg_text arrays for notification purposes to reduce redundancy.
    . Removed the unnecessary get() method call in $user = $job->user()->first().
    . Used array literal syntax ([]) for defining the $response array.
    . Removed the unnecessary type declaration for the return value since the code doesn't enforce a specific type.
    . The class code is too lengthy, it should not be like that, so i moved some function into helper and implement a notification service.
    . Remove unnecessary if else statements. and in some case use ternary conditions.
    . Improved the code formatting and readability.

# Conclusion

    we can furthur improve the code by followig the SOLID priciples. Consider applying SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion) to design and structure the codebase for better maintainability and extensibility.

    Identify common business logic or operations and encapsulate them in separate classes or service providers. This helps improve code organization, reusability, and testability.

    Use Laravel's built-in features: Leverage Laravel's built-in features, such as validation, middleware, and authentication, to improve security, maintainability, and code consistency.

    Follow PSR-12 coding standards: Adhere to the PHP coding standards specified in the PSR-12 guidelines for consistent code formatting and style.

    Create unit tests to validate the functionality of the refactored code. This helps ensure that any future modifications or additions to the codebase do not introduce regressions.

# Code to write tests

    You can find the unit test in tests\app\Test directory. I write the test for both method mention in readme.txt file. these test will evaluate the method by comairing the generated result and expected result and return the outcomse accordingly.
